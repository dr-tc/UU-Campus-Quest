Welcome to Magee's campus reception! You are now in the Martha Magee building, commonly referred to as MD, and affectionately known by students as 'Hogwarts'.

Your quest is to obtain a campus map. This map will reveal the university's layout, guiding you through its various paths and buildings.

**Once you have completed your mission, present your campus map and team selfie to the nearest Student Success Ambassador.**

To commemorate the beginning of your university journey, ask a passing student to take a photo of your team outside 'Hogwarts'. If you're feeling adventurous, ask someone at reception how to activate your student card and then seek out the card activation beacon at the entrance of 'Hogwarts'.
