You have found the hole in the wall. Easy to miss, but essential when you need to sort out a parking dilema! 

Your quest is to take a look at the *{{< styled-link href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/carparks/payments-tariffs" >}}UU Car Parking{{< /styled-link >}}* webpages and work out how much 6 hours parking will cost a student.
{{< div-end >}}
**Once you have completed your mission, speak to the nearest Student Success Ambassador and tell them how much parking costs for a student. If you have also worked out the bonus, let the student ambassador know the secret number! **

To commemorate the beginning of your university journey, ask a passing student to take a photo of your team outside 'Hogwarts'. If you're feeling adventurous, ask someone at reception how to activate your student card and then seek out the card activation beacon at the entrance of 'Hogwarts'.
