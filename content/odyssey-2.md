1. Gather Your Materials: Find a whiteboard or a large piece of paper, along with some markers or pens. Ensure there’s enough space for everyone to draw and see the clues clearly.

2. Pick Your Game: Each team member should think of their favourite game. It could be a video game, a board game, a card game, or any type of game they enjoy.

3. Take Turns Drawing: One by one, each team member will take a turn drawing clues related to their chosen game on the whiteboard or paper. Remember, no words or letters are allowed—only drawings!

4. Guess the Game: The rest of the team will try to guess what game the drawing represents. You can ask questions or discuss among yourselves, but the drawer cannot speak or give verbal hints.

5. Verification by **Student Success Ambassador**: Once your team has made a guess, a Student Success Ambassador will verify that at least one game was guessed correctly. If you guess at least one game right, you’ve completed the challenge!

Now that you’ve become pros at “Game Doodle,” it’s time to crank up the fun with the “Ultimate Game Doodle Showdown”! This time, challenge a Student Success Ambassador to draw their all-time favourite game. But watch out, second-year students are known for their taste in some pretty obscure games, so be prepared for anything!
