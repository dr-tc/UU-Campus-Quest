Preparation by the Student Success Ambassador:

1. Each team member is to approach a Student Success Ambassador and get a sticky note placed on their back or forehead. Each note has the name of a famous game character written on it. These characters could be from popular video games, board games, or any well-known game.

2. The aim is for each participant to guess the character’s name on their sticky note by asking questions that can only be answered with "yes" or "no". Each participant will take turns asking the group a yes or no question about their character. For example: “Am I from a video game?”, “Do I have superpowers?”, “Am I a human character?”.
   
3. Once a team member guesses their character, the Student Success Ambassador will verify the accuracy of the guess.
4. Keep going until everyone has guessed correctly.
